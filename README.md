# 🚀 Bachelor’s Thesis: Flutter App for Live ESP32 Streaming, Photo Capture, and Location Mapping
# 📔 Description :
###  This projet is a cross-platform mobile application built with Flutter that interfaces with an ESP32-CAM module to provide the following key features:
###	📡 Live Video Streaming
Stream real-time video feed from the ESP32-CAM over a local Wi-Fi network directly into the app interface.
### 📸 Photo Capture from Stream
Instantly capture snapshots from the live stream with a single tap.
###	📍 GPS-Based Geotagging
Automatically retrieve and associate the current GPS location of the mobile device with each captured photo.
###	🗺️ Interactive Location Mapping
Display all captured photos on an embedded map Google Maps, allowing users to visually browse images by location.
###	💾 Local Storage Integration
All images are saved in the device’s local storage, allowing offline access and better performance.
# ⚙️ Platform Compatibility :
> [!WARNING]
> 1.  Custom map pin size: Appears correctly on iOS but is too small on Android  <br />
> 2.  ESP32 broadcast: Works reliably on iOS, but not on Android (even with a fixed IP address)
